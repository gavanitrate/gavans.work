      Furthermore, my experience with
      <a href="https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent">Reagent</a>
     has shown me the benefits of defining application views in pure data.
     So, in the process of developing this very lightweight website,
     I began my search for a simple static site generator that supported writing markup in
     <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup">Hiccup</a>. Unfortunately, I quickly learned there was no existing solution.
     But there hasn't yet been a goal I haven't been able to achieve.
     </div><div>
     Born from this frustration is a simple static site generator
     that supports processing markup in Hiccup, styling in SCSS
     and a watcher service to rebuild when changes to the source
     code are detected - all written in pure Clojure.
